## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local installation or cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aaditya-dubey09/devodyssey.git](https://github.com/aaditya-dubey09/devodyssey.git)
    cd devodyssey
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    # Install root dependencies (if any, e.g., concurrently)
    npm install
    
    # Install client dependencies
    cd client
    npm install
    
    # Install server dependencies
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Setup**

    Create `.env` files in both `client` and `server` directories:

    **Server (`server/.env`)**:

    ```env
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/devodyssey  # Or your MongoDB Atlas URI
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
    JWT_EXPIRE=7d
    ```

    **Client (`client/.env`)**:

    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    VITE_NODE_ENV=development
    ```

4. **Start the Development Servers**

    From the root directory:

    ```bash
    # Start both client and server concurrently (requires 'concurrently' package installed at root)
    npm run dev
    ```

    Or start them separately:

    ```bash
    # Terminal 1 - Start server
    cd server
    npm run dev
    
    # Terminal 2 - Start client
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Access the Application**
    - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port, might vary)
    - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`
    - API Documentation: `http://localhost:5000/api-docs` (if implemented)

## Available Scripts

### Root Directory

- `npm run dev` - Start both client and server in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build both client and server for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server (often handled by deployment platforms)
- `npm run test` - Run tests for both client and server

### Client Directory

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Server Directory

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with nodemon
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run test` - Run server tests

## API Documentation

The backend provides a RESTful API with the following main endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/posts` - Retrieve blog posts
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new blog post
- `PUT /api/posts/:id` - Update blog post
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete blog post

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [server README](./server/README.md).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Follow the [Contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
- Maintain [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

The frontend is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Vercel automatically deploys new changes pushed to the `main` branch.

1. Ensure your `client` directory is correctly configured as the **Root Directory** in your Vercel project settings.
2. Set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable on Vercel to your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api`).
    - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
    - **Value**: `https://devodyssey-backend.onrender.com/api` (Replace `devodyssey-backend.onrender.com` with your actual Render backend URL)

### Backend (Render)

The backend is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/). Render automatically deploys new changes pushed to the `main` branch.

1. Ensure your `server` directory is correctly configured as the **Root Directory** in your Render service settings.
2. Set the following environment variables on Render:
    - **Key**: `NODE_ENV`, **Value**: `production`
    - **Key**: `PORT`, **Value**: `5000` (Render will use its own internal port, but your app should still listen on `process.env.PORT` or `5000` as a fallback)
    - **Key**: `MONGODB_URI`, **Value**: `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` (from MongoDB Atlas)
    - **Key**: `JWT_SECRET`, **Value**: `your_jwt_secret_here` (match this with your client's JWT secret if applicable)
    - **Key**: `JWT_EXPIRE`, **Value**: `7d`
3. Configure a **Health Check Path** (e.g., `/api/health`) for better service monitoring.
4. Set **Build Filters (Included Paths)** to `server` to only trigger backend builds on relevant changes.
